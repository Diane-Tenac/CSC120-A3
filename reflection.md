Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Greta and Alice Umugwaneza
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I used to fear java for it being an OOP language which sounded to me complicating, but now I think it has welcomed me in a way that took away the fear and boosted the courage of understanding. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I am still using some python way of approaches and later put them in java, but I have seen that the context are almost the same with minor different in syntax( declaration of variables and function definitions/ java methods do differ.)
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
For someone taking this class in the future, I don't know what they heard about it before if that is overwhelming or exciting but the only advice I would give is to follow your proffessor, open your mind for navigating what's going on and engage yourself into it. It will come.
